  (2, 'ANSWER', 20, 'No. Tampons do not cause cancer. There have been a number of e-mails going around in the past few years alleging that manufacturers add carcinogens like asbestos to tampons to promote bleeding or that tampons contain fiberglass. Neither is true. In fact, tampons have been found safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

  (7, 'QUESTION', 2, 'Can shaving infected hair get rid of critters like scabies and pubic lice?', '2013-11-07 12:28:25'),
  (8, 'ANSWER', 4, 'No. Shaving, dousing with kerosene, hot baths, and other so-called remedies just won''t work. Scabies are mites that belong to the same family as spiders. Pubic lice are tiny insects that look a lot like crabs. Both are transmitted through sexual and intimate contact. They can also be picked up from infested bedding and clothing. Scabies get under the skin. Pubic lice attach their eggs to pubic hair.', '2014-12-31 23:54:02'),

  (11, 'QUESTION', 10, 'Is it true that women who use emergency contraception are at increased risk of ectopic pregnancy?  I’ve heard some anti-choice people make the claim, but it doesn’t sound reasonable.', '2013-10-27 12:46:57'),
  (12, 'ANSWER', 12, 'No, there is no evidence that emergency contraception (EC) increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy — pregnancy outside of the uterus.  One study of only 201 women in the U.K. suggested this possibility, but subsequent studies of thousands of women worldwide demonstrate no increased risk. ', '2013-10-27 14:40:57'),
  (13, 'ANSWER', 5, 'Ectopic pregnancy is more likely for women who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy, for women who have had surgery involving the fallopian tubes, and for women who have had sexually transmitted infections.  Left untreated with medication or surgery, ectopic pregnancy is a very dangerous, life threatening condition.', '2013-10-27 14:40:57'),
  (14, 'ANSWER', 7, 'EC works by stopping ovulation or fertilization.  In theory, it could interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg, but there is no scientific proof that this happens.  EC, however, does not affect an established pregnancy.', '2013-10-28 18:41:57'),

  (15, 'QUESTION', 7, 'Is it true that emergency contraception causes abortion? What about other hormonal methods of birth control?', '2014-02-25 17:03:12'),
  (16, 'ANSWER', 5, 'No. Abortion ends a pregnancy. Emergency contraception (EC) cannot end a pregnancy. EC works before a pregnancy begins. Pregnancy begins with the implantation of the developing fertilized egg in a woman''s uterus.', '2014-12-02 21:03:12'),

  (19, 'QUESTION', 12, 'No. Most women feel relief after an abortion. Serious emotional problems after abortion are much less likely than they are after giving birth. But anti choice extremists make false claims about this. They want people to believe that most women who choose abortion suffer severe and long lasting emotional trauma. This is not true.', '2013-01-09 12:03:12'),
  (20, 'ANSWER', 10, 'For more than 20 years, most scientific studies have found that emotional reactions to having abortion are relatively positive with two exceptions.

Also, women who have to terminate an intended pregnancy are more likely to be emotionally disturbed afterward.', '2013-01-10 21:03:12'),
  (21, 'ANSWER', 50, 'Anti-choice extremists refuse to accept the facts. They insist that "post abortion trauma" is real. They hope that such terms will frighten women away from choosing abortion.

  (28, 'ANSWER', 21, 'It is very unwise to take mifepristone that has been obtained online. The only FDA-approved mifepristone is obtained from Danco Pharmaceuticals, under the brand name Mifeprex. Only Danco can distribute mifepristone to doctors, who sign a special agreement with the manufacturer.', '2014-05-15 12:03:09'),
  (29, 'ANSWER', 68, 'Because you cannot be assured that you are getting real mifepristone from online sources, it is not safe to use what is available through the Internet. In addition, mifepristone is used with another medication, misoprostol, for medication abortion. Both medications are needed to assure maximum safety and effectiveness when an early pregnancy is terminated. Neither should be ordered through the Internet.

Interestingly, research has shown that rates of post-partum psychosis decrease in societies that legalize abortion.', '2014-02-12 18:18:03'),

  (32, 'QUESTION', 69, 'Despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, anti-choice organizations continue to spread the false idea that it is common for abortion to have severe, emotionally negative effects. The fact is that anti-abortion groups have invented this so-called post-abortion syndrome to further their efforts to make abortion illegal and unsafe. The anti-choice studies that claim to prove its existence are very flawed. For example, the authors of the studies only interview women who claim to have emotional problems after abortion. They do not interview women who feel relief, which is the most common emotional response of women who have an abortion in the first-trimester — nearly 90 percent of all abortions happen during the first trimester of pregnancy.', '2014-03-26 17:21:56'),

  (36, 'QUESTION', 8, 'Yeast infections may be due to chronic skin conditions, the use of certain antibiotics, continuing bacterial imbalances in the vagina, excessive intake of milk or sugary products, blood sugar problems related to diabetes, a yeasty sex partner whose chemistry throws off your bacterial balance, or multiple and/or new sex partners. Then, of course, it might be something else!', '2014-01-11 11:20:21'),
  (37, 'ANSWER', 80, 'First, make sure it''s yeast, since sometimes symptoms that may seem like yeast can be caused by another kind of infection. And if that''s what''s going on, yeast treatments won''t help! To find out, make an appointment with your clinician and get a professional diagnosis. Your clinician might suggest an anti-fungal treatment. Some, such as boric acid, are available over the counter. Others require a prescription. All can have side effects, such as irritation.

  (40, 'QUESTION', 46, 'The best way to find out whether or not a partner is faithful is to ask. While it is true that studies have shown that about 33 percent of sex partners are likely to lie about having other partners, ongoing communication between partners about their expectations for faithfulness is very important.

  (41, 'QUESTION', 46, 'Genital warts are caused by certain highly contagious, and very common, types of HPV — human papilloma virus. Warts usually develop six weeks to six months after infection. But it may take longer. And very often, people with the types of HPV that cause genital warts have no symptoms. Sometimes, too, the warts are so small that people who are infected can''t see them. Also, tiny warts can be hidden, unseen, in the folds of the anus, scrotum, vagina, or vulva.', '2014-04-20 21:11:01'),
  (42, 'QUESTION', 65, 'Genital warts are not only common, they also recur. This means that they may appear for a year, then disappear, then reappear two to six months later.

So it may seem that partner B became infected during the relationship with partner A, when that is not the case.', '2014-02-24 15:13:01'),
  (44, 'QUESTION', 100, 'In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a vaccine, Gardasil, that protects against four of the 40 types of HPV that are sexually transmitted. Two of the types, 6 and 11, are the ones that cause 90 percent of the outbreaks of genital warts. The two others, 16 and 18, cause 70 percent of cases of cancer of the cervix. They are also associated with cancers of the vulva, penis, anus, or throat.', '2014-04-21 17:45:01'),
  (45, 'QUESTION', 68, 'Right now, there is no clear evidence that the vaccine will protect an already infected person. Because, however, a person may be infected with one of the HPV types covered by the vaccine but not with another, the vaccine will protect against the HPV type(s) that a person does not already have. The new vaccine does not offer protection against all the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer.

They can also re-infect women partners who have been treated. Sometimes women have no symptoms, either. Symptoms, when they happen, often take three to 28 days to develop after exposure.
